Q.1 What are IIFE?

ans -> Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is one of the most popular design patterns in JavaScript. 
      IEFE solves this problem by having its own scope and restricting functions and variables to become global.
      The functions and variables declare inside IIFE will not pollute global scope even they have same name as global variables & functions.

Q.2 What is currying?

ans-> Currying is a function that takes one argument at a time and returns a new function expecting the next argument.
     It is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).
    
    use of currying: 1) Currying is a checking method to make sure that you get everything you need before you proceed.
                     2) it makes my code readable.
                     3) It helps you to avoid passing the same variable again and again.
